    <h1>Kata: String Cleaning</h1>
    <p>
        Your boss decided to save money by purchasing some cut-rate optical character recognition software for scanning <br>
        in the text of old novels to your database. At first it seems to capture words okay, but you quickly notice that  <br>
        it throws in a lot of numbers at random places in the text. <br>
        <br>
        Examples (input -> output) <br>
        '! !'                 -> '! !' <br>
        '123456789'           -> '' <br>
        'This looks5 grea8t!' -> 'This looks great!' <br>
        <br>
        Your harried co-workers are looking to you for a solution to take this garbled text and remove all of the numbers.  <br>
        Your program will take in a string and clean out all numeric characters, and return a string with spacing and  <br>
        special characters ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,? all intact. <br>
